# PARSE AND GRAPH THE TWITTER TIMELIME OF ANY USER:

## This Python script will analyse a twitter feed and draw a pie chart of the 10 most used words.

It has been inspired by the *MItx 6.001x* course and by *@yanofsky*

As it is now, it works only for tweets written in *English* but you can make it work
in any language as long as you modify the blacklist.txt file to get
coherent results

First you'll need to get your Twitter API credentials here by creating a new
app:
https://apps.twitter.com

I created it and tested it on Donald Trump Twitter feed:

In the first input prompt, enter the user name like _realDonaldTrump_ or _BarackObama_ and run it.

I need to add much more words in the blacklist.txt file to have it working
nicely on any english written feed.
